                <p><a href="http://w3schools.com"> W3Schools </a><br /><br />
                    The W3Schools website is an excellent resource for many introductory aspects of various programming languages. It thoroughly covers elements of web design from front-end HTML and CSS to backend JavaScript, Programming, Server control. 
                    While the information on the website is not incredibly advanced and doesn’t go into much technical depth, the purpose of this resource is to show you good starting points for many of these programming concepts and provide good examples of their integration. 
                    One very nice feature of the W3Schools website is that it has integrated examples that allow you to see code snippets and corresponding web output in real time, allowing you to experiment and learn web design right on the website. 
                    While this resource is a great learning tool for early developers, I feel like it can be used for a quick refresher by user of all experience levels.  
                    I was personally introduced to the website in my first ever programing class and have been using it as a resource since, It is my go to site for looking up simple code or syntax reminders when dealing with HTML/CSS.

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"> Stack Overflow </a><br /><br />
                    Stack Overflow is the most popular online programming community, where there are countless threads, question, answers, and examples for every aspect of programming. 
                    This resource is one of the best to troubleshoot with, because there have been millions of other users asking and answering questions, which means it is a great first step in trying to figure out a solution to your bug or challenge. 
                    Additionally, if there was no existing answer, the website has a constantly active global community, which can likely answer your questions in a very short time frame. 
                    A large portion of the userbase are programming professionals, which may be intimidating for less experienced users with most of the questions and answers being relatively advanced. 
                    But knowing that this is the go-to platform for almost all developers I’ll continue to use the resource to find similar questions, and hopefully be answering other users questions someday.

                <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/"> Microsoft Docs </a><br /><br />
                    Microsoft Docs is a resource very similar to W3Schools, where it is also a vast resource for a wide variety of programming concepts, but the way it differs from W3 would be that the topics it covers are much more advanced. 
                    And while I prefer W3 with their coverage of the programming fundamentals, Microsoft Docs goes much further in depth, in terms of related properties, methods, events and implementation. 
                    This is also a professional grade resource in any topic which means that the documentation and presentation of all of their content is more advanced with few integrated examples like in W3, 
                    and instead simply the example code that a user can take and try in their own IDE or implement directly into their program. 
                    I’ve noticed myself gradually searching for answers through Microsoft Docs over W3 in recent quarters, and predict that I will continue to use this platform more.

                    This is another resource created by Microsoft, effectively giving you a lightweight .net IDE inside your browser. 
                    I’ve found this website to be a great tool in collaboration with Microsoft Docs, or Stack Overflow where I’m able to effectively test and experiment with other users code snippets within a light IDE, 
                    that doesn’t require me to launch visual studio or any other more power intensive apps. 
                    I feel like this tool can be useful for all experience types, as its always useful to have a light development environment that you can use for small tasks. 
                    I don’t think this program would replace any more powerful tools like an installed IDE, as it has the same feature set of notepad, lacking any prompting or internal library. 
                    However, I don’t consider that a drawback, as the intended use of this tool is different, and I’ve been happily using it when searching through online code forums.

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ptWR16ITQyYOglXyQmpzw"> I am Tim Corey </a><br /><br />
                    This is a YouTube channel that I’ve been particularly fond of over the last few years. I have always preferred visual learning and have gone through many different video resources and YouTube channels dedicated to covering programming concepts. 
                    I think that Tim Corey has one of my favorite online platforms, and his free YouTube classes have been incredibly helpful. The topics he covers regarding C# have ranged from absolute beginner to very advanced programming concepts. 
                    While his information seems suitable for programmers of every experience level, a lot of his more advanced classes and features are locked behind a paywall on his own website, which does lower my recommendation. 
                    However, the content that he does have for free on YouTube has been consistently informative for several years now.

                <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> The Odin Project </a><br /><br />
                    The Odin project has been a great resource for me to use alongside my class content, It is a free open source programming class that has a step by step curriculum made to introduce new concepts of programming, 
                    and break down the fundamentals of a programming language. The program has several project assignments that would look great on any beginning developers portfolio, and offers a variety of classes based current requirements for web development jobs. 
                    I’ve been using this program as a refresher over the summer break and look forward to completing it by next summer, and could see myself starting a new course after that.
